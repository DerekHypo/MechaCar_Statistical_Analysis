# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Project Overview
* Perform multiple linear regression analyses to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The dataset for the 50 MechaCar prototype vehicles has 6 variables: (vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, all-wheel-drive assignment, miles per gallon).

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
